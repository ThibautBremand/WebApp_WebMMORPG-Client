# HTML5 & JavaScript Client

Web browser based client, written in pure HTML5 and JavaScript.
For the server, please see http://github.com/ThibautBremand/os-server

The game has been designed in a way that all the communication intelligence is deported to the server side, so it will be easy to develop more clients in other technologies.
